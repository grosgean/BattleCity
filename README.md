# BattleCity

I created it in Microsoft Visual C# 2010 Express, Microsoft XNA Game Studio 4.0 Refresh

This project is my first experience in C#, XNA and gamedev also.
I started it after the course "Beginning Game Programming with C#" in coursera.org.
It took me about 3 month of my spare time, some days I did a lot, some weeks I did nothing.
I tried it to be as similar to original Battle City as it is possible;

There is only 1 player, 10 levels, 6 bonuses.
Sprites and sounds had been downloaded from public sites.

There is many to do but all main things are working.
Maybe there is some bugs, but I leave it "as is".
Control: Arrows, Space, Enter - start & pause.

You need to copy this files to Projects folder of Visual Studio, open it and start by Ctrl-F5.

There is also compiled version in file battle.zip.
You can simply setup it without Visual Studio.

In Fabruary 2015 on coursera.org starts new course Beginning Game Programming with C#, 
so I leave it for the students.
